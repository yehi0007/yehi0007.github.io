                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                <img src="myself.jpg" alt="image of myself">
                <p> 
                </p>My name is Habiba Yehia and I live in Canada with my family, but I am originally from <strong> Egypt</strong>, and It is our 5<sup>th</sup> year in Canada. Among my four siblings, I am the oldest sister. I also have another sister and two brothers. As part of my weekly practice, I strive to learn new languages, and I go to the library and take classes in it every week. These days, I am learning <em>Spanish</em>, because I am very interested in learning new words and practising lessons, since I am extremely passionate about it.
                <p><strong>Mathematics</strong> is my favourite subject and I am always eager to learn more about it. Therefore, <strong>Web Development</strong> is an exciting course for me, and I have already completed an online course about why <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is important, and I am beginning to gain more knowledge about <abbr title ="Hybertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, and I am also interested in learning how to create visually appealing designs and build secured websites in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program.My passion is to explore and gain more knowledge about advanced fields to get more experience and develop my career. <em style="font-size: larger;">Particularly</em> in this generation, where I have the greatest chance of growing up.</p>
                <p> Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preserving the body are my biggest passions in life. I've also researched what <em> vitamins</em> to consume and drink to maintain basic hormones, <strong>but</strong> H<sub>2</sub>o elements are definitley the critical element to preserve our bodies since water displays the major element that keeps the body hydrated and build a <b> healthy</b> body, therefore, it is indispensable in our life.</p>
